<h1>krello</h1>

<p>A Trello clone using the MEAN stack</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<li>Making APIs with Node.js is really simple and minimalistic, though also very barebones</li>
<li>Angular is pretty heavy in terms of size and amount of DSL, and had directly observable perfomance issues when hovering over lists and cards that contained many directives and kept track of lots of state</li>
<li>Coded in February 2016</li>

<h4>Technologies Used</h4>
<li>Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Angular 1.5</li>
