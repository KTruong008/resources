# old-taurus

<p>First attempt at making a monolith-styled Django-powered API with a React frontend in a classic todo app.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<li>Don't ever name folders arbitrarily like you did in this project again</li>
<li>Merging React JS files into Django's static file handling system is more trouble than it's worth, it's better to keep API separate from client for modularity and better separation of logic</li>
<li>Organizing React folders strictly into actions, containers, and reducers leads to less manageable code and folders that are more coupled than necessary</li>
<li>I think this project was done sometime in the Spring or early Summer of 2016</li>

<h4>Technologies Used</h4>
<li>Django, React, Redux, Django REST Framework</li>
